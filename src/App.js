Since I also love using Alexa in my daily life, I saw this as a great opportunity to refresh my AWS skills as well!",

        "I chose the ESP12F, specifically the NodeMCU D1 Mini, for several reasons. First, its compact size makes it ideal for attaching to a medication bottle. Second, it includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, which are essential for sending notifications and integrating with AWS.",
        "The initial design prioritizes power efficiency by keeping the system in deep sleep mode when not in use. To enable automatic wake-up, the RST and GPIO16 (D0) pins are connected, allowing the board to reset. A normally open (N.O) reed switch acts as the trigger, initiating the reset sequence whenever it is disconnected.",
        "When the bottle is closed, the magnet is positioned near the reed switch. When the bottle is opened and the magnet moves away, the RST pin transitions from HIGH to LOW, triggering a reset operation",
        "Upon waking, the setup() function executes, either sending a notification or message to another ESP8266 before immediately returning to deep sleep. This ensures minimal power consumption, as the system only activates once or twice a day, striking a balance between functionality and battery life."

Functionally, the system worked as intended, successfully detecting bottle openings and sending alerts.",
          "However, this approach proved impractical in real-world use. The entire process‚Äîfrom detection to notification‚Äîtook 10‚Äì20 seconds, during which the user could have already taken the medication and put the cap back on, which would interrupt the operation. Additionally, the reliance on Wi-Fi connectivity and message transmission made the system power-hungry, which is a major drawback for battery-powered applications.",

        title: "Second Prototype - Two ESP8266s",
        bullets: [
        "A second breadboard prototype was developed using two ESP8266 modules. In this setup, one ESP8266 functions as a client attached to the medication bottle. Its sole responsibility is to detect the reed switch state and send a message to the server ESP8266 when the bottle is opened.",
        "The server ESP8266, powered via USB, handles the more power-intensive tasks‚Äîreceiving the message from the client, connecting to Wi-Fi, and sending the notification. This separation of responsibilities significantly improves power efficiency, as the client module avoids the high energy consumption associated with Wi-Fi connectivity and notification handling.",
        "One small limitation of this setup is that both ESP-NOW and Wi-Fi operate on the same 2.4 GHz frequency and cannot run simultaneously. As a result, after receiving a message from the client, the server must temporarily disable ESP-NOW to connect to Wi-Fi and send the notification. While this works well for a single-client system, it could present challenges in a multi-client setup. If the server is connected to Wi-Fi and unable to receive ESP-NOW messages, communication from other clients may be missed.",

          "To enable this functionality, I created a DynamoDB table to store timestamps whenever the medication bottle is opened. When the server ESP8266 detects the event, it sends a REST API POST request to an AWS API Gateway endpoint. This triggers a Lambda function that records the timestamp in the DynamoDB table, ensuring the data is securely and accurately stored in real time.",
          "Building on this foundation, I developed a custom Alexa skill that allows users to ask, ‚ÄúHave I taken my medication today?‚Äù When prompted, Alexa queries the DynamoDB table through another Lambda function, checks for the last recorded activity, and checks if the date matches the current date. This is so much more practical and useful than email or text notifications for someone like me!",

        bullets: ["The third version of the project involved assembling all components onto a compact perfboard, powered by a CR123A battery. The most challenging part of the build was soldering, which took some practice to get used to.", 
          "The system functioned as expected, but the battery drained in under 24 hours, which was a major concern. Several possibilities could explain this rapid drain: the deep sleep function may not have executed correctly, the circuit design might be flawed and causing a constant draw, or deep sleep is working but still consuming more power than anticipated.",
          "Through further research, I discovered that the NodeMCU D1 Mini boards sometimes require two reset signals to fully reboot. I observed that when the magnet was removed from the reed switch, the board would reset inconsistently‚Äîsometimes it triggered a full reset, and other times it didn‚Äôt. It appears that the first reset may only wake the board without executing the setup() and loop() functions, while the second reset fully initializes the board. If only one reset is triggered, the board may stay awake without re-entering deep sleep, leading to significantly increased battery usage.",

          "I plan to experiment with different circuit designs using a normally closed reed switch. In this setup, the reed switch will be placed between the battery and the 3.3V pin of the board. When the magnet is close, the reed switch remains open, completely cutting off power to the board. When the magnet moves away, the switch closes, allowing current to flow and turning the board on.",
          "This design could be more efficient than using deep sleep since, in theory, it should consume no power when the bottle is closed. By fully cutting off power instead of relying on deep sleep mode, battery life could be significantly extended, making the system more practical for long-term use."
